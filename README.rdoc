= EightShapes Blocks
EightShapes Blocks is the official internal code name for our HTML prototyping toolkit. This name may or may not be used for a potential public version of the toolkit. This intranet directory will be our near-term location for publishing documentation, instructions, specs, and other notifications about the program.
